## Game Overview
This game will be a side view space shooter game. The player may move forward or back and up and down within the play field. The player will use weapons and sheilds to attack other enemies and defend itself against attacks from other enemies. Each level will be a set length and the playable area will move along the level.

## Game Development Updates

### October 5, 2020
The game window opens and the player ship renders to the screen. It can then move up, down, left and right. It also limits itself to the edges of the screen. I have also made the player stop before the top and bottom of the screens to leave space for a UI for game information.
